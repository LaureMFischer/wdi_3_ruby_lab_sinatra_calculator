# Sinatra Calculator

Create a *basic* calculator application using Sinatra. 

You should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

Your URL might look something like `/math/1/sum/2`

Your application should use a 'layout' file to render the shared HTML code between views.

No database is needed for this.
