# Sinatra Calculator

Create a *basic* calculator application using Sinatra. 

You should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

Use an HTML form with a text input for each of the numbers, and a dropdown for the operation. This will use the **GET** method instead of the POST method to a URL, which will then render the results in HTML. 

## Bonus

Apply basic CSS styling to the application.
